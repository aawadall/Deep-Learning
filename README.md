# Deep-Learning
_My attempt to implement a generic deep learning platform using Python_

I am aware that there are plenty of development frameworks out there implementing effecient deep learning in Python.
This library is to give me enough understanding of the internals of such algorithms.

Feel free to fork it, tinker with it and update if you happen to find somehting not right

## Project Progress
* I just added seed code to build GUI for this library (nothing useful yet)
* I also added entry point program at /code folder named `deep.py`
* I moved all potential deep learning releated code into a ne folder named /core 

## Upnext 
extract code from the most updated scrapbook.py into respective classes
