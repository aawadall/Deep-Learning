# TODO: This module is to define one or two functions required by a Convoluted Neural Network
# Final product expects an array of stacked images, 
# in addition to some tuning parameters such as image size, patch size, pad size and stried
# output is three dimensional matrix such that Each image is sliced into patches as defined above
# and each dimension represents one of the following:
# image instance, patch, pixel in patch 
# This output will be used later on as an input to another layer that will take one output per patch as a separate feature for the smae instance
