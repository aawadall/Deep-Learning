## Minimum Viable Product
1. A Deep Neural Network library supporting Python
1. Tunable hyperparameters
1. Support for the following activation functions:
    * [ ] Sigmoid 
    * [ ] tanh
    * [ ] ReLU
    * [ ] Softmax 
1. Robust initialization, training and production 

## Good to have 
1. Implement sample implementation with a given dataset where users canchange hyperparameters 
1. Re-implement above implementation with UI 
1. Publish above on Web application
